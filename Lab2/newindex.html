            <p> Pumpkin Spice Latte (PSL) is a popular seasonal coffee drink featuring espresso, steamed milk, pumpkin puree, and a blend of warm spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, and ginger, typically sweetened and topped with whipped cream and a sprinkle of spice, with Starbucks credited for its popularization in 2003. Homemade versions use real pumpkin and spices for a cozy, autumnal treat, often customized with various milks and sweeteners, and are available as hot or iced drinks.</p>
