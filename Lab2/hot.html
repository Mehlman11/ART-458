    <h1>What is Hot Latte</h1>
     <img src="hot latte.webp" alt="Delicious looking coffee">
    <p>A hot latte is a comforting coffee drink made with a shot of espresso, lots of steamed milk for creaminess, and a light layer of milk foam on top, with endless flavor variations like vanilla, caramel, or mocha, and even unique options like honey spice or orange. You can easily make them at home using espresso (or strong coffee), milk, and a frother, adding syrups or spices to customize your perfect warm beverage.</p>
